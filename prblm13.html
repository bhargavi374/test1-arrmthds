    <h3>Bank Transaction Validator
        Scenario: You’re designing a system to check if a user has sufficient funds for a transaction.
        Problem: Determine if a user can make a withdrawal based on their balance and withdrawalAmount.
        Input:
        balance (float),
        withdrawalAmount (float).
        Conditions:
        If balance ≥ withdrawalAmount, allow the transaction.
        If balance < withdrawalAmount, reject the transaction. Expected Output: "Transaction Approved"
            or "Insufficient Funds" . Example: Input: balance=500.0, withdrawalAmount=200.0
            Output: "Transaction Approved" </h3>

                let balance = +prompt("enter your balance:");
                let withdraw = +prompt("enter the amount to withdraw:");
                if (balance >= withdraw) {
                    console.log(`transaction approved`);
                }
                else {
                    console.log(`insufficient funds`);
                }
